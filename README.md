# What is CRUD?
CRUD is an acronym for four of the major functions when interacting with a database programmatically. These functions are, respectively:
* (C) Create - Adds new data to the database. For example, adding a new user to a system.
* (R) Read - Retrieves data from the database, such as viewing a list of all users of searching for a specific one.
* (U) Update - Modifies existing data. For example, changing a user's email address.
* (D) Delete - Removes data from the database, like deleting an account.

Together, CRUD operations are the foundation of dynamic applications and are commenly used with programming languages
(like Java, Python, or JavaScript) with a database (MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL). Whether you're building a web-app or mobile-app,
understanding CRUD is essential for effective data management.

## Purpose of the Project
This project is relatively similar to one that I had to create for one of my senior-level courses. It involves a very basic ASP.NET website structure,
revolving around 4 main webpages. Each of these pages corresponds to a specific function in CRUD; For instance, 
'Login' represents 'Read', 'Registration' represents 'Create'; so on, so forth. This website is tied to a backend database that is owned by the university,
so once I graduate then the application may become deprecated, we'll see.

## Feel Free to Look Around!
I uploaded this project so that others may find inspiration, or maybe learn something just as I have. Enjoy!
